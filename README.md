A new AI-based voice cloning technique has been developed that requires only five seconds of speech data to generate a synthesized voice. The system consists of three components: a speaker encoder, a synthesizer, and a neural vocoder. The speaker encoder is a neural network trained on thousands of speakers to learn the essence of human speech, and it compresses speech data into a representation. The synthesizer takes text input and produces a Mel Spectrogram, which is a representation of someone's voice and intonation. The neural vocoder produces a waveform as output. The naturalness and similarity of the synthesized voice can be measured using the mean opinion score, and the paper contains a detailed evaluation section. The technique has been supported by Weights & Biases, which provides tools to track experiments in deep learning projects.
