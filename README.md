A new AI-based voice cloning technique has been developed that requires only five seconds of speech data to generate a synthesized voice. The system consists of three components: a speaker encoder, a synthesizer, and a neural vocoder. The speaker encoder is a neural network trained on thousands of speakers to learn the essence of human speech, and it compresses speech data into a representation. The synthesizer takes text input and produces a Mel Spectrogram, which is a representation of someone's voice and intonation. The neural vocoder produces a waveform as output. The naturalness and similarity of the synthesized voice can be measured using the mean opinion score, and the paper contains a detailed evaluation section. The technique has been supported by Weights & Biases, which provides tools to track experiments in deep learning projects.

#Deep fake Video detector
The rise of deepfake videos has made it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and fake videos. However, a new paper called "FaceForensics++" introduces a tool that uses a dataset of manipulated and original video pairs to help detect deepfake videos. The tool uses a neural network to detect tampering and can accurately detect which method was used to tamper with the footage. The system can even detect deepfakes hidden within compressed videos. The paper emphasises the importance of making people aware of deepfake videos and the potential harm they can cause.

DEEP fake you can generate 
This video from Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér reveals that practically anyone can now create deepfake videos using a learning-based algorithm. By recording a video of oneself and adding just one image of the target subject, the algorithm translates all the movements of the driving video to the target video with high accuracy. This technique requires no additional information about the target image, making it more general and applicable to various image types, including non-humanoid and cartoon models. The algorithm uses a neural network to generate all the required information and warp the target image appropriately. Although the output is impressive, there is still room for improvement in reducing visual artifacts generated during sudden head movements. Nonetheless, the source code and an example Colab notebook are accessible, making it one of the most accessible papers in this area. The video discusses the importance of informing the public about this technology's availability and attending EU and NATO conferences to inform key political decision-makers about this technique's capabilities. Ultimately, the video emphasizes the need to make people aware of the existence of deepfake videos and their creation and its consequences to take appropriate measures.

#FACE storation#
A new artificial intelligence (AI) technique, GPEN, has been developed to restore low-quality photos of historical figures, such as Einstein. Though previous methods created idealized images, GPEN is capable of preserving wrinkles and other high-frequency effects, delivering more natural and detailed results. Researchers note that the identity preservation feature can be controlled, making it useful in restoring images of synthetic characters. The new technique is fast and efficient, producing 14 restored images per second. The system is available online for experimentation, allowing users to restore images of their choice.
